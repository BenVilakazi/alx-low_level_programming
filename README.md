# alx-low_level_programming.

## Introduction.

Each directory contains the low level projects and code that I've written during my first sprint at ALX. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects are to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind C, algorithms, and basic data structures. There is info and trivia questions that I go over in each directory.

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :---|
| [0x00. C hello world ](./0x00-hello_world) |  Hello, World |
| [0x01. C variables, if, else, while ](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | Variables, if, else, while |
| [0x02. C functions nested loops ](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Functions, nested loops |
| [0x03. Debugging ](./0x03-debugging) | Debugging |
| [0x04. C more functions, nested loops ](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | More functions, more nested loops |
| [0x05. Pointers arrays strings ](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | Pointers, arrays and strings |
| [0x06. More pointers, arrays, strings ](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | More pointers, arrays, strings |
| [0x07. Even more pointers, arrays, strings ](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | Even more pointers, arrays, strings |
